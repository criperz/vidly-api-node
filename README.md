## Introduction

This project is the backend of Vidly, an imaginary video rental app.
This is the implementation of Vidly in Node.js.

### Install the Dependencies

Next, from the project folder, install the dependencies:

    npm i

### Populate the Database

    node seed.js

### Run the Tests

You're almost done! Run the tests to make sure everything is working:

    npm test

All tests should pass.

### Start the Server

    node index.js

This will launch the Node server on port 3900. If that port is busy, you can set a different point in config/default.json.

### Environment Variables

If you look at config/default.json, you'll see a property called jwtPrivateKey. This key is used to encrypt JSON web tokens. So, for security reasons, it should not be checked into the source control. I've set a default value here to make it easier for you to get up and running with this project. For a production scenario, you should store this key as an environment variable.
